# SM64 Speedruns - A SQL and Python Project
** Ignore any redundant / unnecessary comments, they're mainly just notes for me because I am a noob :]

Learning Python for data analysis / science and wanted to test what I've learned so far on a personal project using a dataset from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/code/mcpenguin/super-mario-64-speedruns-data-collection) This dataset

Updated the dataset files to include a RUN_ID column to later replace the original "id" column. Updated the PLACE column for each PLATFORM. On speedrun.com the platforms are in separate tabs with their own placing.

I also haven't used git in a while so this is also sort of a guinea pig for re-learning that.
